    "Using exTwitter data, I try to assess the possibility of using non labeled data to improve a transformer-encoder based model for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will try to predict whether posts are considered hate speech, offensive language or neither. This has a level of difficulty, as the the two categories of interest of interest often overlap. The distinction is however very important as offensive language is but a cultural perception of certain words as less prestigious, while hate speech can go as far as to be a criminal offense in certain jurisdictions and is usually used in order to discriminate. There is an important difference between saying *let's fucking do this* and *the fucking [ethnicity of your choice] did this*.\n",

    "First things first, we will need to load the [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset). While the original dataset comes with some additional information about the labeling process and the text appears in raw form, I have already preprocessed it outside of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, I only maintained the labels and the text, as these are the two variables of interest for this particular report. Aditionally, I already passed the raw text through the transformer blocks of the [all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) which was designed to return the sentence embeddings. While it would be interesting to fine-tune this model for the task at hand, I decided against it as I am working on a small cuda-less notebook. Therefore, I only used the model to get the embeddings for each datapoint and we will do the SSL using a custom head for the model.\n",
